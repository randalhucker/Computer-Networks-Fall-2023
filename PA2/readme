This document contains important usability information for our submission of the following assignemnt:

CS4065 Computer Networks and Networked Computing
Project 2 - A Simple Bulletin Board Using Socket Programming
Instructor: Giovani Abuaitah

## Instructions for compilation

No additional libraries or packages are needed to run these programs.

In order to compile and run the client / server, one must simply run the `launch_client.py` and `launch_server.py` files respectively. If you are working out of a terminal, this is as simple as running the following commands (the terminal must be working out of the root project directory):
* Server: `python launch_server.py`
* Client: `python launch_client.py`

Both programs support command line options to specify the IP address and port to which the client must connect, which can be viewed by running the above command with the addition of a `-h` or `--help` flag. A summry will be provided below:
* Client Options:
    * -h, --help   show this help message and exit
    * --ip IP      Server IP address
    * --port PORT  Server port number
The address of the server and port are preset, but if they were to be changed, the client command line options could be used to connect to it. If the client is run without options, its default connection setting is the same as the server's

## Usabiliy Instructions

Once the client connects to the server, it will prompt the user to enter their name. Afte this occurs, the general 'Enter Message: ' prompt will be displayed. All input is entered to this prompt. 

Our program allows the user to send a message to their current group (begins as default) by simply typing what they wish to send.

Messages must be entered in the following format: 'subject' message
* subject is an optional field, if left empty the message will be sent without a subject

To use a command, the user must type a '!' character followed by a command from the list below. Each command is given with a description of the arguments they require and what it their function is.

Note: Pay attention to the description of each command as the naming convention is different than what is outlined in the project description.

Commands:                           
* !get_groups                     (get a list of the groups created)
* !join 'group_name'              (join a group)
* !send 'group_name' message      (send a message to a group)
* !get_members 'group_name'       (return the members of a group)
* !leave 'group_name'             (leave group)
* !get_message 'id' 'group_name'  (get message with id from a group)
* !switch 'group_name'            (switch current message context to a different group)
* !disconnect                     (disconnect from the server)
* !help                           (display this help message)

Group names may not contain special characters: 
* use underscores instead
